Threads

Android Threads
1. Never, ever, ever block the Main/UI thread.
2. Do not access the UI from a non-UI thread.

- Android UI toolkit is NOT thread safe.
- Main thread is blocked if it takes too long to complete something and displays an error message.
    - could be accessing a file on the file network or complex computations.

Process Heirarchy: Which Process Gets Killed
1. Foreground Process (most important, req'd for what the user is doing right now)
    Running an Activity the user is interacting with.
    BroadcastReceiver that is currently running
    Service currently excecuting code in a call block.
2. Visible Process
    Activity visible on screen ,but not active (aka onPause() has been called).
    A service is running in the foreground.
    Service that manages something the user might be aware of.
3. Service Process
    Hosting a service that is started
    Usually not as visible to users, but doing something the user cares about (uploading / downloading somethign).      
4. Cached Process
    Not currently active, but could become active soon.
