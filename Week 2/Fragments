Fragments
    + Reusable UI components for android apps.
    + Object oriented thinking
        + Encapsulation and reusability
        + Subclassing (extend)
    + Android Thinking:
        1. Reusable portion of your app's UI
        2. Own layout, own lifecycle, handles own input events.
        3. Fragments cannot live on their own.
        4. Hosted by an activity of another fragment.
        5. Fragment's view hierarchy becomes part of the host's view hierarchy.
    
    Example:

        class ExampleFragment extends Fragment {
            public ExampleFragment() {
                super(R.layout.example_fragment);
            }
        }
