Why Angry Birds was So Successful
    + Simple yet engaging interaction concept.
        + Simplification meaning: once users have a relatively brief period of experience
        with the software, their mental model of how the interface works is fully embedded.
            + this is known as "schema formation"
            + Takes place during a cycle called "First User Experience".
        + Adding more detail to the user's mental model at the right time === engaging!
            + Addictive due to the expansion of the user's mental model & incremental increases in problem / solution methodology.
    + Cleverly Managed Response Time.
        + "The faster the response time, the better."
        + Not every aspect of the UI needs to be as fast as possible.
        + One huge problem for user interfaces -- error correction.
        + Angry birds had slower bird flight / impact, which allowed the user to take stock of what happened and make
        corrections on their next throw, thereby increasing engagement.
    + Short Term Memory Management.
        + The designers created short-term memory loss
        + This increased game complexity, but was not a negative outcome for the user.
    + Mystery
        + The second layer of attributes that are present but undefined explicitly.
        + "Why did they do that?" as opposed to "What were they thinking?"
    + How things sound
    + How things look
        + Offensive linemen effect -- you only notice it if it isn't there!
