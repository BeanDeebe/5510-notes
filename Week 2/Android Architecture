Android Architecture

- Overview
  + Open Source OS
  + Reference Code & Design
  + Developer APIs and Tools

 Android platform built on a Linux Kernel.
 
 Each app runs its own instance of ART (Android Runtime).

The stack looks like this, top down:
 + System Apps
    + Dialer / Email / Calendar / Camera / etc.
 + Java API Framework
    + View System, Resource Manager, Notif Manager, Activity Manager, Content Providers
 + Native C / C++ Libraries && Android Runtime
 + Hardware Abstraction Layer
    + Audio / Bluetooth / Camera / Sensors libraries
 + Linux Kernel
 + Power Management.

 Activity Lifecycle States
   Lifetime
      + onCreate (setup "global" state)
         + where all large operations should happen (data gathering, etc.)
      + onDestroy (release all major resources)
   Visible Lifetime ("behind glass door")
      + onStart (register BroadcastReceivers)
         + getting ready to interact with the user
      + onStop (unregister)
         + means you're not visible
   Foreground Lifetime (frequent switching)
      + onResume (user interacting, lightweight code)
      + onPause (commit changes, lightweight code)
         + means you're not focused.
