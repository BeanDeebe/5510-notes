Tasks and the Back stack
    + Task: a collection of activities that are part of an application.
    + Stack: Activities that are arranged in the order they are activated by the user.

Principles of Navigation in Android
    + Fixed start destination
        + This is the first screen a user sees when launching app.
        + Last screen they see when pressing the back button.
    + Nav state is rep'd as a stack of destinations
        + Upon new launch, a new task is created for the user.
        + This becomes the base destination for the Back Stack.
        + All future activities get pushed onto this stack. When the back button is hit, the top activity is destroyed.

The Back stack operates on a LIFO object structure.
