Material Design

Android vs iOS 
iOS - apps conform to a set of technical and UX requirements... consistency!

Android - apps can implement their own interaction idioms
    creative interfaces
    differences can be jarring

Goals of material Design
    1. Create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and
    possibility of technology  and science.
    2. Develop a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. 
    Mobile precepts are fundamental, but touch, voice, mouse, and keyboard are all first-class input methods.

More Devices increases need for consistency
    Google Watch
    Google Home
    Google Glass

Primary Principles
    1. Material is the metaphor.
        Inspired by real-world materials and physics.
        Objects have an x-y-z location, a z-position, and a depth.
        Ambient light creates soft, directional shadows.
    2. Bold, graphical, and intentional.
        Visually consistent across apps.
        Provide heirarchy.
        meaning.
        focus.
    3. Motion provides meaning
        Motion is important and meaningful.
        Must be in service of the user's intention, not just for fun / whimsicality.
